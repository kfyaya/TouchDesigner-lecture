Water color pouringï¼Œsilk embroidery, and abstract geometry, depict the impressions of the holy mother river. 
In the misty moonlight, by the colorful flowers, with shimmering ripples, appears the dreamy spring river.

Historical epic and traditional rhythm, music performance and immersive new media art, generative algorithm and artistic design
join to present our new media art Concert: Dialogue 2.0

Color ink and embroidery both embody traditional Chinese aesthetic styles, while computer-generated art methods and visually rendered images in real-time propose new creative techniques for audio-visual interaction. 
In this concert, we explore how to use new media art methods to generate stylized videos that externalize the musical content. 

"Dialogue 2.0" is a collision between Chinese classical music and contemporary music. Accompanied by the pianist's unique live performance, the audience experiences a unique Yellow River journey from the glacial lakes, winding through grasslands, to the breathtaking waterfalls with boatmen in the turbulent waves, and finally broadening up to the fertile farmland. We believe that interactive generative art preserves the uniqueness of live music performances, re-emphasizing the importance of live performance. Therefore, the physical gestures of live performances and the visual storytelling of the Yellow River spirit are all woven into the algorithms to perform for the auciences.
